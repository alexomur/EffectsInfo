# EffectsInfo
EXILED SCP:SL plugin that shows the user his current effects.

It's my very first practice plugin.

# Config
```DRS:
EffectsInfo:
  is_enabled: true
  debug: false
  # Default hint text
  hint_text: '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<align=left>          Effects:</align>'
  ```

It's planning to add Intensity to the Effects which is stackable and timer for not infinite Effects.
